Welcome to the repository for flow simulation project using Star CCM+. 
The project involves simulation of sudden expansion of flow in a standard CFD nozzle.
This repositiory includes:
1. Flow simulation files for flow through a CFD nozzle standardized by FDA
2. Technical presentation to guide you through the project
3. Simulation done on 3 mesh sizes - 1mm, 0.5mm and 0.3mm
4. Three models for simulating turbulence: k-eps, k-eps low Re and k-omega sst

Note: The simulations have been validated against three standard experimental results mentioned and referred to in the technical presentation
